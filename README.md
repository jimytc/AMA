# holman/ama

A repository to ask [@jimytc](https://twitter.com/jimytc) anything.

I have developed in Ruby for 7 years, mostly as a Ruby on Rails developer. I was an Android developer before. Most of my career time are about backend engineering. I sometimes [write](https://jimytc.com) about engineering, collaboration. If you have a question you're interested in reading me tap out a response for, this is just the joint for you.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/jimytc/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/jimytc/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 280 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@jimytc](https://twitter.com/jimytc) on
